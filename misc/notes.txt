GPU ARCHITECTURE

GPUs are designed to run single-instruction multiple threads(SIMT) programs.
You run the same program over multiple data.

Run this program for 1600x900=1,440,000 pixels.
pixel[i] = convert_to_bw(pixel[i]);

There is a limit to the number of threads per block, since all threads of a block are expected to reside
on the same streaming multiprocessor core and must share the limited memory resources of that core.
On current GPUs, a thread block may contain up to 1024 threads.

However, a kernel can be executed by multiple equally-shaped thread blocks, so that the total number of
threads is equal to the number of threads per block times the number of blocks.
